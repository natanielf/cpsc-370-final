A Day on the Town

One day, my best friend, PERSON, and I decided to visit PLACE.

We were so ADJECTIVE to see all the people! As soon as we got there, we saw a ADJECTIVE PERSON.

It was VERBing so ADVERB that everyone around us shouted, "EXCLAMATION!"

Next, we went to see PERSON.

They were VERB with a OBJECT.

My friend thought it was ADJECTIVE, but I thought it was ADJECTIVE.

After that, we stopped for lunch and saw PERSON VERBing near PLACE.

It was the most ADJECTIVE day ever!

When it was time to leave, we shared a final VERB and left.
