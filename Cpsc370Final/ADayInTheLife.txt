"A Day in the Life of PERSON"

This morning, I woke up ADVERB and immediately felt ADJECTIVE. I checked my phone and saw that PERSON had DMed me saying, "EXCLAMATION! you need to VERB right now!"

Without thinking, I grabbed my OBJECT and ran outside. The streets were filled with ADJECTIVE OBJECT, all VERBing ADVERB. It felt like I was trapped inside PLACE.

I knew I had to act fast. I channeled my inner ADJECTIVE PERSON and decided to VERB. The moment I did, everything around me turned ADJECTIVE. Suddenly, I was face-to-face with PERSON, holding a OBJECT in one hand and a OBJECT in the other.

"EXCLAMATION!" I shouted. "What do you want from me?"

They looked at me ADVERB and whispered, "You must VERB before it’s too late."

Not wanting to disappoint, I took a deep breath, VERBed, and prepared to VERB. Just then, a ADJECTIVE PERSON appeared out of nowhere and yelled, "EXCLAMATION! You have no OBJECT!"

I stared at them, feeling ADJECTIVE. Maybe they were right. Maybe I was just a ADJECTIVE PERSON all along. But there was no time for self-doubt—I had a mission to complete.

With one final VERB, I ADVERB VERB ed, knowing that the fate of OBJECT rested in my hands.
